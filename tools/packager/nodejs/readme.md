The [`wa-kitchen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wa-kitchen) package provides JavaScript/TypeScript developers with structured artifacts extracted directly from **WhatsApp Web**.
It exposes internal schemas, protocol definitions, constants, and metadata used by WhatsApp’s web client — enabling high-level or low-level automation tooling, reverse-engineering work, and unofficial integrations.

This package is generated by the **wa-kitchen extraction pipeline**, which continuously monitors WhatsApp Web updates and produces normalized, versioned outputs.
