**wa-kitchen** is a workspace that tracks WhatsApp Web updates, extracts internal definitions, and produces language-friendly packages for unofficial WhatsApp integrations and automation tooling.

It acts as a *build pipeline* that continuously watches WhatsApp Web, parses its artifacts, and “cooks” them into structured, versioned modules you can consume safely.
